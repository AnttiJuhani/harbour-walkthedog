Description: |
  Walk The Dog is a simple application to track dog walking activity. |
  With this application you can record start time and end time
  when taking dog out to walk. The application has one month history and it
  provides you some statistical data on latest activities: |
  One month activity log. |
  Last seven day summary. |
  Graphical presentation about the time of day when walking activity has happened. |
  Walk The Dog is my first application with QML and Sailfish.
  It is partly experimental. Both portrait and landscape mode are supported. |
  Hint: If you don't know what to do, there is a
  blinking animation added to components that you can interact with.
